## About

<img src="readme-assets/PlantsSensor.jpg" width="50%">

Do you struggle to keep your houseplants healthy and hydrated? Introducing Keep My Plants Alive, a full-stack system that makes it easy to monitor soil moisture levels in your plants.

Our system features moisture sensors that can be placed in water or soil. The sensors send readings to an Express API, which then displays the data on easy-to-read gauges in a React app. And the best part? It all runs on a convenient raspberry pi.
