## About

<img src="readme-assets/PlantsSensor.jpg" width="50%">

Do you struggle to keep your houseplants healthy and hydrated? Introducing Keep My Plants Alive, a full-stack system that makes it easy to monitor soil moisture levels in your plants.

<img src="readme-assets/PiSensor.jpg" width="50%">

Our system features moisture sensors that can be placed in water or soil. The sensors send readings to an Express API, which then displays the data on easy-to-read gauges in a React app. And the best part? It all runs on a convenient raspberry pi.
