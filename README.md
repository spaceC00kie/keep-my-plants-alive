# Keep My Plants Alive!

## About

<img src="readme-assets/PlantsSensor.jpg" width="50%">

This full-stack system monitors soil moisture levels in houseplants. Data from moisture sensors is retrieved from an Express API and a React app displays the moisture readings. Both run on a raspberry pi.

The sensors can be put in water or soil and the moisture percentage readings will be displayed on gauges on the webpage.
