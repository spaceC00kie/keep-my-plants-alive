# Full Stack Test

## About

This is a full-stack system to monitor soil moisture levels in houseplants. An express api takes in data from moisture sensors and a react app shows the output from the api. I have both running on a raspberry pi.

You can put the sensors in water or soil for data. When the react app doesn't receive any data it will show the message "Failed to Connect!" in a banner above the gauges and the gauges will read 50%. Otherwise, there will be no error message and the gauges will show the moisture level from each sensor.
